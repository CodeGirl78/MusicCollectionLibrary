# MusicCollectionLibrary
Liftoff Project

**Overview**

My project will be a music collection library that will allow users to create an account, login and out of their account once created and create their very own music library. They will be able to update their library by adding and/or deleting albums which will include artist’s first and last name, album title, and genre of music. They will also be able to utilize search functionality by searching for a particular artist or group, album title, or by genre.

This project was motivated by my need for organization of my own music library in which I’m an avid collector of CDs, cassette tapes, and record albums. It is my hope that other avid music collectors will be able to find this useful for their collections as well.
